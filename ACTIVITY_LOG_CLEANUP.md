# Activity Log Cleanup System

## Overview
The memo activity logging system has been enhanced with cascading delete functionality to ensure database cleanliness and storage space conservation. When a memo is deleted, all related activity logs are automatically removed.

## New Functions

### 1. Enhanced `deleteMemoFromFirestore(memoId)`
- **Location**: `firebase-config.js`
- **Functionality**: Deletes a memo and all its associated activity logs
- **Process**:
  1. Queries for all activity logs with matching `memoId`
  2. Deletes all activity logs in parallel
  3. Deletes the memo document
  4. Logs the operation with count of deleted logs

### 2. `deleteActivityLogsForMemos(memoIds)`
- **Location**: `firebase-config.js`
- **Functionality**: Bulk deletion of activity logs for multiple memos
- **Usage**: Useful for batch operations when multiple memos are processed

### 3. `cleanupOrphanedActivityLogs()`
- **Location**: `firebase-config.js`
- **Functionality**: Removes activity logs that reference non-existent memos
- **Usage**: Database maintenance to clean up orphaned records
- **Returns**: Number of cleaned up logs

## Admin Dashboard Functions

### 1. `cleanupOrphanedLogs()`
- **Location**: `admin-dashboard.html`
- **Access**: Available in browser console for administrators
- **Functionality**: Calls the cleanup function and shows results

### 2. `bulkDeleteSelectedMemos()`
- **Location**: `admin-dashboard.html`
- **Access**: Available in browser console for administrators
- **Functionality**: Bulk delete selected memos and their activity logs
- **Safety**: Includes confirmation dialog

## Usage Examples

### Single Memo Deletion
```javascript
// This now automatically deletes activity logs
await deleteMemoFromFirestore('memo-id-123');
```

### Bulk Activity Log Cleanup
```javascript
// Clean up orphaned logs
const cleanedCount = await cleanupOrphanedActivityLogs();
console.log(`Cleaned up ${cleanedCount} orphaned logs`);
```

### Admin Console Commands
```javascript
// Clean up orphaned logs
cleanupOrphanedLogs();

// Bulk delete selected memos (if checkboxes are selected)
bulkDeleteSelectedMemos();
```

## Benefits

1. **Storage Conservation**: Automatically removes orphaned activity logs
2. **Database Cleanliness**: Prevents accumulation of useless data
3. **Performance**: Reduces query time and storage costs
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensures referential consistency

## Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Bulk operations require user confirmation
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
3. **Logging**: All operations are logged for audit purposes
4. **Parallel Processing**: Efficient batch operations using Promise.all()

## Migration Notes

- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- New functions are backward compatible
- No manual migration required
- Orphaned logs can be cleaned up using the new cleanup function
